# Dataset ZW3D200 for the paper "Robust and discriminative 3D point cloud zero-watermarking scheme based on multi-feature attentional fusion"
The directory 'origin' contains 200 original 3D models, and other directories contain their attacked counterparts. For example, there is a file named '1146261_sf.obj' in the directory 'origin' and the directory '1146261_sf' contains the attacked models of it.
These 200 3D models from Thingi10k are all under open source licenses. For more details about the license, please refer to [1].
